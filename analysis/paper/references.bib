	Abstract = {A wedge-shaped pattern of variation in stream fish standing stock estimates relative to a habitat variable, in which range of standing stocks increases as a function of the variable, is consistent with the concept that the habitat variable is a limiting factor for fish populations. This pattern of variation complicates interpretation of parameter estimates and significance of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression models of conditional mean standing stock; slopes of these regression models may have little or no relation to slopes of models describing standing stock limits. We modeled standing stock limits by testing for homoscedastic error distributions, screening plots of coordinate pairs for evidence of a wedge-shaped pattern of data, and estimating 90th regression quantiles for simple linear models. Application of this technique to data sets supporting 35 previously published OLS regression models of stream fish standing stocks led to rejection of homoscedasticity (P < 0.10) in 13 of the 35 data sets. Eight of these heteroscedastic data sets had wedge-shaped patterns of variation in standing stock and slopes of 90th regression quantiles that differed from slopes of OLS regression models. For three of these eight data sets, tests rejecting homoscedasticity were more significant than tests rejecting zero slope parameters in OLS regression models. In a separate exercise, analysis of simulated standing stock data generated from known distributions indicated that our technique can detect heteroscedastic error distribution patterns and yield 90th regression quantile models of standing stock limits from data sets characterized by OLS regression as having no correlation between mean standing stock and a habitat variable. Identification of correlations between habitat variables and standing stock by OLS regression is a common method of determining whether a variable is to be used for habitat assessment. Application of our technique to data sets that display wedge-shaped patterns of variation should help identify variables that may be limiting standing stock from data sets that do not yield significant OLS regression models of mean standing stock.},

@article{Sweka2010,
	Abstract = {Atlantic salmon Salmon salar are at critically low levels in Maine rivers and maintaining current populations depends heavily on the stocking of hatchery-produced fry. Fry survival varies greatly not only among rivers but also within rivers. Better understanding of this spatial variability is needed to improve population recovery efforts. Quantile regression was used to examine how parr density varies along stream gradients as a function of the upstream cumulative drainage. Regression quantiles (τ  =  0.15--0.90) had significant negative slopes indicating that, in general, as cumulative drainage area increased, parr density decreased. The τ  =  0.90 quantile model, which may be viewed as an upper limit to parr density for a given cumulative drainage area, was density  =  [10⁁(1.0679 − 0.0013 · km2)] − 1. Quantile regression models were then combined with river-specific habitat data in a Geographic Information System to predict total Atlantic salmon parr production in several rivers. This analysis will help managers determine the potential of a stream reach or entire river to support Atlantic salmon parr and to prioritize and increase the effectiveness of management activities such as fry stocking and habitat restoration.},

	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of a natural resource is an important consideration in designing an efficient survey or monitoring program for the resource. Generally, sample sites that are spatially balanced, that is, more or less evenly dispersed over the extent of the resource, are more efficient than simple random sampling. We review a unified strategy for selecting spatially balanced probability samples of natural resources. The technique is based on creating a function that maps two-dimensional space into one-dimensional space, thereby defining an ordered spatial address. We use a restricted randomization to randomly order the addresses, so that systematic sampling along the randomly ordered linear structure results in a spatially well-balanced random sample. Variable inclusion probability, proportional to an arbitrary positive ancillary variable, is easily accommodated. The basic technique selects points in a two-dimensional continuum, but is also applicable to sampling finite populations or one-dimensional continua embedded in two-dimensional space. An extension of the basic technique gives a way to order the sample points so that any set of consecutively numbered points is in itself a spatially well-balanced sample. This latter property is extremely useful in adjusting the sample for the frame imperfections common in environmental sampling.},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

	Abstract = {The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models-Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)-for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

	Abstract = {We used temporally consistent patterns in the spatial distribution of returning adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to explore relationships between salmon abundance, landscape characteristics, and land use patterns in the Snohomish River watershed, Wash. The proportion of total adult coho salmon abundance supported by a specific stream reach was consistent among years, even though interannual adult coho salmon abundance varied substantially. Wetland occurrence, local geology, stream gradient, and land use were significantly correlated with adult coho salmon abundance. Median adult coho salmon densities in forest-dominated areas were 1.5--3.5 times the densities in rural, urban, and agricultural areas. Relationships between these habitat characteristics and adult coho salmon abundance were consistent over time. Spatially explicit statistical models that included these habitat variables explained almost half of the variation in the annual distribution of adult coho salmon. Our analysis indicates that such models can be used to identify and prioritize freshwater areas for protection and restoration},

@article{Nickelson1992,
	Abstract = {Habitat use by juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) during spring, summer, and winter was examined in Oregon coastal streams. Coho salmon fry were most abundant in backwater pools during spring. During summer, juvenile coho salmon were more abundant in pools of all types than they were in glides or riffles. During winter, juvenile coho salmon were most abundant in alcoves and beaver ponds. Because of the apparent strong preference for alcove and beaver pond habitat during winter and the rarity of that habitat in coastal streams, we concluded that if spawning escapement is adequate, the production of wild coho salmon smolts in most coho salmon spawning streams on the Oregon Coast is probably limited by the availability of adequate winter habitat.},

	Abstract = {Random forests were introduced as a machine learning tool in Breiman (2001) and have since proven to be very popular and powerful for high-dimensional regression and classification. For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm is competitive in terms of predictive power.},

	Abstract = {Estimates of fish abundance from electrofishing surveys depend on accurate estimation of capture probability. We examine in this paper how estimates of capture probability and abundance of Atlantic salmon from multi-pass removal sampling can be improved by comparing the results of an experimental programme of closed electrofishing sites within selected rivers in west-central Norway, and those obtained from open electrofishing sites established for monitoring long-term juvenile Atlantic salmon population abundance within the Burrishoole catchment, western Ireland. We first establish that the Carle & Strub method provides a more robust estimate of population abundance than the Zippin and Seber methods. We then show how prior information on capture probability may be used to improve the accuracy of the abundance estimate in open sites. We also show that the use of prior information with single-pass electrofishing may improve the accuracy of the abundance estimate so that it is comparable with that of multi-pass electrofishing in terms of stock prediction while requiring less sampling effort.},

@article{Eastwood2003,
	Abstract = {There is a growing need for accurate and interpretable maps that describe the spatial extent and suitability of flatfish habitats. A common approach to developing such maps is to construct spatially explicit habitat models from fisheries-independent survey data. As the entire range of factors that define fish habitats can never be fully quantified, habitat models are invariably built from a small subset of factors, which typically consist of physical seabed and water column characteristics. If important physical and biological habitat features have not been measured, conventional modelling techniques may underestimate habitat use and quality. We present a spatial modelling technique capable of estimating the maximum extent and suitability of flatfish habitats, i.e. the potential or upper limits of the habitat, using juvenile sole (Solea solea L.) in the Dover Strait as an example. To develop the models, juvenile sole catch densities and environmental habitat data were first acquired and assembled within a Geographical Information System (GIS). Regression quantiles were then estimated for models of change in juvenile sole catch density according to changes in a number of habitat variables. Finally, spatial models were constructed within a GIS by combining the quantile regression models with digital maps of the environmental variables. The use of regression quantiles allowed linear model parameters to be estimated near to the upper bounds of the sole-habitat relationships, thereby providing estimates of the limiting effects of the habitat. In turn, the habitat map built from the upper regression quantiles provided robust estimates of the maximum spatial extent and suitability of sole nursery grounds in the Dover Strait region, as confirmed by model tests using independent data. Habitat maps developed using this approach may be desirable from a species conservation perspective, as the likelihood of underestimating the extent and quality of the habitat is reduced.},
